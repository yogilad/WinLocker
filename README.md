# WinLocker
WinLocker replaces the Windows built in desktop locking behavior (built into the screen saver functionality), in cases where this behavior is disabled due to domain policies

To use:
1. Compile the project 
2. Move bin\Release\WinLocker.exe to the desired location 
3. Lunch 

The application presents a Notification Icon for interactions with the user.
* Double Clicking on the icon changes states - See tooltip for information about transitions.
* The right click menu allows to set the idle time before lock, suspend the lock for various periods of time, 
   and disable the lock all together
* In addition, you can enable and disable auto-start from the right click menu.
